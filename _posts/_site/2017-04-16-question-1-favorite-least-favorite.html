<h1 id="what-is-your-favorite-thing-about-providing-technical-support">What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I enjoy problem solving and helping people in general. Being support engineer enables me to face different challenges, which I have the opportunity to troubleshoot different problems and help others succeed with our products during life-long journey of learning.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-did-you-think-of-our-service-during-the-time-you-used-it">What did you think of our service during the time you used it?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Netlify has a well written, organized support documentation and I’m comfortable finding
things that I want with the directory, although I didn’t need to go deep into the API. Netlify is very straightforward to use overall during the time I used it.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="tell-about-how-you-made-your-site-and-why-you-chose-the-tools-you-did">Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I used Jekyll to build this site. The reason I chose Jekyll is because I have a GitHub Page and it is powered by Jekyll, so I’d like to learn how Jekyll works. I installed Jekyll through RubyGems and it has a straightforward doc to follow through just as Netlify.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="could-you-give-us-a-suggestion-to-improve-this-test-or-the-job-posting">Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I’d suggest to have questions that involves interactions with the Netlify APIs to better
address the other questions regarding technical support.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="provide-a-link-to-documentation-for-a-technicaldeveloper-focused-product-that-you-think-are-well-done-and-briefly-explain-why-you-think-they-are-well-done">Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.</h1>

<ul>
  <li>https://developer.github.com/v3/ I like the GitHub API docs because it is clean and nicely structured with different chapters. It contains straightforward instructions and guidelines for each commands or api interactions. Code snippets also help a lot for beginner developers or people who never use the API.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="why-do-you-think-sslhttps-is-important">Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>SSL/HTTPS is important because it is essential for safe network communications in modern internet. When people exchange/transfer private and sensitive information over the web, this type of information need to be protected from malicious attacks through encrypting the connection between the request sender and the request recipient. With JAMstack in particular, making any API requests using SSL is necessary for the purpose of securing the real, accurate content communication away from outside injections/attacks.</li>
